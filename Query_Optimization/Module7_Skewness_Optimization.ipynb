   "source": "### 7.1 Background\n\nThere are three main types of skewness that can happen during a query execution that can slow down query performance:\n\n1. Data distribution skewness\n\nThis can happen when the underlying data for a table is not evenly distributed across multiple files. Different workers can read different amounts of data after the TableScan operator, which can cause uneven processing between workers while executing a query.\n\n2. Join key skewness\n\nThis can happen when we try to join two tables with data unevenly distributed based on the join key condition. Since the HashJoin operator distributes data during the processing based on the joining key(s), different workers will receive different amounts of data in such a case, and can result in processing skewness.\n\n3.  Probe side skewness\n\nThis happens when the table that is put on the Probe side of the join requires a small number of file scans (this can be due to a small table or a large table with restrictive filtering conditions). Since one file/partition can only be read by a single worker instance, the number of worker instances involved in the query processing will be limited to the number of instances used in the table scan. This skewness can carry to the downstream operators of the query processing if its path does not become the Build side on later joins( i.e., to reuse the same worker without redistribution of the data), hence can result in processing skewness throughout the whole process.\n\nIn this module, we will focus on the third scenario mentioned above.\n"
