First, Let's disable result cache so that we can test the query performance properly (should you need to run this notebook multiple times).\n\nMake sure that the warehouse to run this Notebook is `WH_SUMMIT25_PERF_BASE`. This is to ensure that we can easily do reporting based on different workloads. You can also double check it from Notebook Setting menu if you want to."
