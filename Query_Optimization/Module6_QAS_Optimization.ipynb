    "## Module 6. Query Acceleration Service for Performance Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Module 6 is to explore how SOS can improve a query’s performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Identify QAS Candidates & Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we will explore when Query Acceleration Servie can improve query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's identify eligible candidates of QAS. You can run the following query from account_usage views:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    query_id, \n",
    "    eligible_query_acceleration_time\n",
    "FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_ACCELERATION_ELIGIBLE\n",
    "WHERE\n",
    "    start_time > DATEADD('day', -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())\n",
    "ORDER BY eligible_query_acceleration_time DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However there might be up to 24 hours latency for account_usage view QUERY_ACCELERATION_ELIGIBLE, which is not practical for our 90-Mins HOL. So we have developed an SP using the system function SYSTEM\\$ESTIMATE_QUERY_ACCELERATION from information schema since SYSTEM\\$ESTIMATE_QUERY_ACCELERATION only supports a single query ID. As you may know, information schema is available immediately with real-time or near real-time availability. \n",
