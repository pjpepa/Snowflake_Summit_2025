Materialized Views for Performance Tuning \n\nModule 4 is to focus on exploring and discovering how a query can benefit from Materialized View.\n\n### 4.1 Identify MV Candidates\n\nIn this step, we will explore on how to determine if Materialized View can help in improvement performance of our queries. MV is mostly helpful on expensive aggregations. There are many ways to decide on expensive aggregation. Here we use a simple way based on the number of rows of aggregation output for the sake of time. You can also make decision based on spillage depending on your workloads and needs."
